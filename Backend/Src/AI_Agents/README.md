# Aetharia Backend AI Agents

This folder will house logic for AI agents that are embedded into zone/game server runtime, including:

- NPC behaviors
- Zone-based dialogue logic
- Basic LLM integrations scoped to world modules

> Not to be confused with the global `ai-agents/` directory, which is for full independent AI runtimes.
